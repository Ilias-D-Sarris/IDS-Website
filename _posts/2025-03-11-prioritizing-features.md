title:  "Prioritizing Features When Everything is 'High Priority'"

## Introduction: The Prioritization Paradox

As product managers, we often face a seemingly endless stream of feature requests, bug fixes, and new ideas.  A common problem is that many, if not most, of these items are labeled as "high priority" by stakeholders.  This creates a prioritization paradox: if everything is a high priority, then *nothing* is truly a high priority.  This lack of focus can lead to wasted resources, project delays, and ultimately, a product that fails to meet user needs effectively.  Effective prioritization is crucial for focusing efforts, managing resources, and delivering a successful product.


## The MoSCoW Method: A Simple Framework

One simple yet powerful technique for tackling this challenge is the MoSCoW method.  MoSCoW stands for **Must have**, **Should have**, **Could have**, and **Won't have**.  This method forces you to categorize each feature request into one of these four categories:

*   **Must have:** These are the features that are absolutely critical for the product to function or meet its core purpose. Without these, the product is not viable.
*   **Should have:** These are important features that significantly enhance the product's value, but they are not essential for launch. They can be added in later iterations if time and resources allow.
*   **Could have:** These are nice-to-have features that would improve the user experience, but their absence wouldn't significantly impact the core functionality.
*   **Won't have:** These are features that are explicitly excluded from the current scope, either due to technical limitations, resource constraints, or strategic decisions.  Clearly defining what you *won't* build is just as important as defining what you will.

The MoSCoW method helps teams have honest conversations, make difficult choices, and create a shared understanding of priorities.


## Example: Applying MoSCoW to a To-Do List App

Imagine we're building a simple to-do list application. Here's how we might categorize some potential features using MoSCoW:

*   **Must have:** Add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, delete tasks.
*   **Should have:** Set due dates, create multiple lists, edit existing tasks.
*   **Could have:** Color-coded categories, task reminders, recurring tasks.
*   **Won't have:** Integration with social media, voice control, real-time collaboration.

This simple exercise immediately clarifies which features are essential for the initial release and which can be deferred or discarded.


## Conclusion: Focus and Deliver Value

Prioritization is a continuous process, not a one-time event.  By using a framework like MoSCoW, product teams can maintain focus, make informed decisions, and ultimately deliver a product that provides real value to users. Don't be afraid to say "no" (or "not now") to features that don't align with your core goals.


## Further Reading

If you'd like to explore product management and prioritization in more detail, I recommend the following books:
