# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  bio    : >-
    I was born in Florina, Greece, currently living in Greece's 2nd largest city, Thessaloniki. I have also lived in New York, Los Angeles, London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, and Istanbul.  
  
    I love building technology products that positively affect people's lives, and being part of the ongoing digital transformation, doing my part to ensure that this transformation is inclusive and will be to society's benefit.  
  
    In my free time you can catch me reading, playing chess, or watching films (and exercising, but not as much as I should!).  
  
    You can read more about me in the [About Me](/about/) section.
